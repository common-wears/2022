Swarm intelligence leverages collective behaviours emerging from interaction and activity of several “simple” agents to solve problems in various environments. One problem
of interest in large swarms featuring a variety of sub-goals is swarm clustering, where the
individuals of a swarm are assigned or choose to belong to zero or more groups, also called
clusters. In this work, we address the sensing-based swarm clustering problem, where clusters are defned based on both the values sensed from the environment and the spatial distribution of the values and the agents. Moreover, we address it in a setting characterised
by decentralisation of computation and interaction, and dynamicity of values and mobility
of agents. For the solution, we propose to use the feld-based computing paradigm, where
computation and interaction are expressed in terms of a functional manipulation of felds,
distributed and evolving data structures mapping each individual of the system to values
over time. We devise a solution to sensing-based swarm clustering leveraging multiple
concurrent feld computations with limited domain and evaluate the approach experimentally by means of simulations, showing that the programmed swarms form clusters that
well refect the underlying environmental phenomena dynamics.
