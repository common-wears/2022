Voice signals contain rich information about human health, and pathological conditions often manifest as distinctive distortions in vocal features. This paper explores **acoustic and signal-based characteristics of pathological voice distortions**, identifying which features provide the most discriminative power for detecting and classifying vocal pathologies. The study emphasizes the importance of robust feature extraction for developing **human–machine systems** that support medical diagnostics and continuous health monitoring. Results suggest that carefully selected features can improve classification performance, paving the way for practical applications in **computer-aided voice pathology detection**.<!--more-->
