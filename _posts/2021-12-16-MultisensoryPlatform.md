Why do groups perform better than individuals? The answer is hidden behind the concept of the so-called Collective Intelligence (CI). CI is defined as the ability of a group to perform a wide variety of tasks, and team behavior and individual characteristics are CI consistent predictors. A complex environment in which CI is increasingly recognized as a determinant of safe and efficient functioning is the operating room (OR), where individual inputs and efforts should be adapted to those of teammates to accomplish shared goals. To date, although teamwork failure accounts for 70â€“80% of serious medical errors, the lack of quantitative measurements of individual responses and interpersonal dynamics makes CI poorly characterized in OR. This work proposed an innovative wearable platform for monitoring physiological biomarkers and joint movements of individuals while performing tasks. ECG trace and breathing waveform combined with skin conductance and movements patterns of both wrist and elbow are recorded unobtrusively and without impairing any activity of the user. The preliminary assessment of these devices was carried out by performing two trials (i.e., in a static condition to have the user baseline and while handling tools for simulating typical surgical tasks). This study with its preliminary findings, can be considered the first attempt toward the establishment of an innovative strategy to improve team performance and consequently, surgical outcomes and patient safety in the clinical routine.
