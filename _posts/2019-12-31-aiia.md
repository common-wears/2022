A number of scientific and technological advancements enabled turning the Internet of Things vision into reality. However, there is
still a bottleneck in designing and developing IoT applications and services: each device has to be programmed individually, and services are
deployed to specific devices. The Fluidware approach advocates that to
truly scale and raise the level of abstraction a novel perspective is needed,
focussing on device ensembles and dynamic allocation of resources. In
this paper, we motivate the need for such a paradigm shift through three
case studies emphasising a mismatch between state of art solutions and
desired properties to achieve.
