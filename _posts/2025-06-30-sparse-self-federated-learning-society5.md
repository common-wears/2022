The growing demands of **Society 5.0** require intelligent systems that are both cooperative and energy efficient. This paper introduces **Sparse Self-Federated Learning (SSFL)**, a novel paradigm combining sparsification with self-federation to reduce communication and computation costs in distributed training. By leveraging sparsity, the approach ensures **lightweight yet accurate models**, while self-federation allows nodes to autonomously coordinate their training without centralized orchestration. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in **energy efficiency and scalability**, highlighting the potential of SSFL for large-scale cooperative intelligence on edge devices and cyber-physical systems.<!--more-->
