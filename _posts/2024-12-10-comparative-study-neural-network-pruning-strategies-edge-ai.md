Efficient deployment of AI models on edge devices requires balancing predictive accuracy with resource constraints. This chapter presents a **comparative study of neural network pruning strategies**, evaluating their impact on accuracy, sparsity, and computational efficiency. By systematically analyzing different pruning approaches—such as weight pruning, structured pruning, and hybrid strategies—the authors highlight trade-offs between compression rate and performance. The results provide practical guidance for selecting pruning techniques suited for edge environments, supporting reliable and resource-efficient AI deployment in real-world applications.<!--more-->
