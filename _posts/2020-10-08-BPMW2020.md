The term IoT-aware business processes refers to the interplay of business processes and Internet of Things concepts. Several studies have been carried out on such a topic, so a better awareness of the current state of knowledge can be beneficial. In particular, in a given application domain, this can help the choice of the most suitable modelling approach. This paper reports on the results of a systematic literature review with the aim of developing a map on modelling notations for IoT-aware business processes. It includes 48 research works from the main computer science digital libraries. We first present a description of the systematic literature review protocol we applied, then we report a list of available notations, discussing their main characteristics. A focus has been devoted to modelling tools and application scenarios. Finally, we provide a discussion on the capability of the identified modelling notations to represent requirements of scenarios enriched by IoT adequately.
