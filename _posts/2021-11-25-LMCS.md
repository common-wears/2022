Emerging application scenarios, such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the
Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing, call for coordination approaches addressing
openness, self-adaptation, heterogeneity, and deployment agnosticism. Field-based coordination is one such approach, promoting the idea of programming system coordination
declaratively from a global perspective, in terms of functional manipulation and evolution
in “space and time” of distributed data structures called fields. More specifically regarding
time, in field-based coordination it is assumed that local activities in each device are
regulated by a fair and unsynchronised fixed clock working at the platform level. In this
work, we challenge this assumption, and propose an alternative approach where scheduling
is programmed in a natural way (along with usual field-based coordination) in terms of
causality fields, each enacting a programmable distributed notion of a computational “cause”
(why and when a field computation has to be locally computed) and how it should change
across time and space. Starting from low-level platform triggers, such causality fields can
be organised into multiple layers, up to defining high-level, collectively-computed time
abstractions, to be used at the application level. This reinterpretation of the traditional
view of time in terms of articulated causality relations allows us to express what we call
“time-fluid” coordination, where scheduling can be finely tuned so as to select the triggers
to react to, generally allowing to adaptively balance performance (system reactivity) and
cost (resource usage) of computations. We formalise the proposed scheduling framework
for field-based coordination in the context of the field calculus, discuss an implementation
in the aggregate computing framework, and finally evaluate the approach via simulation on
several case studies.
