In the last fifteen years, there has been a widespread diffusion of wearable sensorized devices for a plethora of applications in heterogeneous domains. Wearable technology provides fundamental capabilities such as smart sensing, monitoring, data recording, and multi-modal interaction, in a seamless, pervasive, and easy-to-use way. An emerging research trend is the definition of situation-aware wearable computing systems, i.e., wearable devices able to perceive and understand what is happening in the environment in order to adapt their behavior and anticipate users’ needs, a capability known as situation awareness. Although the increasing interest of the research community in situation-aware wearable devices, there is a lack of studies, formal models, methodological approaches, and theoretical groundings on which these systems can be grounded. As a result, a very limited number of smart sensors (physical or virtual) capable of effectively and efficiently supporting Situation Awareness have been proposed so far. In this article, we provide a survey and a classification of state-of-the-art situation-aware wearable systems, outlining current research trends, shortcomings, and challenges, with an emphasis on the models, approaches, and computational techniques of situation awareness and wearable computing on which they are based. The survey has been performed using the PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews. The analysis has been conducted with respect to a reference architecture, namely SA-WCS, of a generic situation-aware wearable computing system that we propose in this article, grounded on Endsley’s model of Situation Awareness. Such reference architecture not only provides a systematic framework for the comparison and categorization of the works, it also aims to promote the development of the next generation WCS.<!--more-->
