This paper introduces **FRASP** (Functional Reactive Approach to Self-Organisation Programming), a novel macro-programming paradigm that reinterprets aggregate computing through the lens of **functional reactive programming (FRP)**. Implemented as a Scala DSL, FRASP provides reactive abstractions—such as `Flow` for time-varying distributed computations and `NbrField` for neighbor data—that enable declarative specifications of self-organizing behaviors. Examples include gradient creation and self-healing communication channels. Through microbenchmarks, FRASP demonstrates efficient and expressive modeling of adaptive collective behaviors in distributed systems.<!--more-->
