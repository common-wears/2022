Pneumonia remains a major global health concern, and chest X-ray imaging is one of the most common diagnostic tools for its detection. This paper presents an **experimental comparison of deep learning models** applied to pneumonia classification in chest X-ray datasets. The authors evaluate several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and training strategies, analyzing their performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness. The results provide insights into the **trade-offs between model complexity and diagnostic reliability**, offering practical guidance for deploying AI-driven medical imaging tools in healthcare settings.<!--more-->
