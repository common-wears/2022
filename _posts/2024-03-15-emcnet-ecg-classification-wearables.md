Accurate classification of ECG signals is vital for early detection of cardiovascular conditions, particularly in wearable healthcare devices with limited computational resources. This paper presents **Emcnet**, an **ensemble multiscale convolutional neural network** designed for **single-lead ECG classification**. By combining multiscale convolutional feature extraction with ensemble strategies, Emcnet captures both fine-grained and global temporal patterns in ECG signals. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Emcnet achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while remaining efficient enough for deployment on wearable platforms.<!--more-->
