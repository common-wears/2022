Deploying binary classifiers on constrained platforms requires models that are both compact and accurate. This chapter explores the **miniaturisation of binary classifiers through sparse neural networks**, showing how sparsification techniques can significantly reduce memory and computational costs while retaining high predictive performance. The authors present comparative analyses of different sparsity levels, demonstrating the trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, and discuss the potential of sparse models as a practical solution for **resource-limited edge and embedded AI applications**.<!--more-->
