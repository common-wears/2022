Swarm programming is focused on the design and implementation of algorithms for large-scale systems, such as fleets of robots, ensembles of IoT devices, and sensor networks. Writing algorithms for these systems requires skills and familiarity with programming languages, which can be a barrier for non-expert users. Even if visual programming environments have been proposed for swarm systems, they are often limited to specific platforms or tasks, and do not provide a high-level programming model that can be used to design algorithms for a wide range of swarm systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a low-code swarm programming environment, called ScaFi-Blocks, which allows users to design and implement swarm algorithms visually.
