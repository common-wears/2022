Sparse neural networks are increasingly recognized for their ability to deliver compact yet accurate models. While much work has focused on binary classification, this chapter investigates the role of **high sparsity strategies** in **multi-class classification** tasks. The authors evaluate the trade-offs between sparsity levels, classification accuracy, and model efficiency across diverse datasets. Results indicate that, under appropriate sparsity thresholds, multi-class classifiers not only maintain performance but in some cases even outperform their dense counterparts. These findings support the use of sparsification as a practical method for building efficient AI models deployable in real-world, resource-constrained environments.<!--more-->
