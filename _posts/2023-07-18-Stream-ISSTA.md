Stream Runtime Verification (SRV) has been recently proposed for monitoring input streams of data while producing output streams in response. The Aggregate Programming (AP) paradigm for collection of distributed devices has been used to implement distributed runtime verification of spatial and temporal Boolean properties. In this paper we outline how distributed SRV could be implemented by AP and the new opportunities AP could bring to the field of distributed SRV.
