The design of community-oriented wearable systems requires controlled environments where new algorithms and interaction paradigms can be tested. This paper presents a **proximity-based wearable computing testbed** that enables experimentation with group dynamics, social interaction models, and context-aware applications. The testbed integrates wearable devices equipped with proximity sensors to capture **real-time co-location and interaction patterns**. Validation experiments demonstrate the system’s capability to model community behaviors, offering researchers a robust platform for developing and testing collaborative wearable applications in pervasive computing scenarios.<!--more-->
