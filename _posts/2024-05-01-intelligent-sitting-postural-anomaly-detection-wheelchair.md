Continuous monitoring of sitting posture in wheelchair users can enable early detection of health-related changes in functional status. Traditional observation methods rely on intermittent clinical assessments, which limit timely interventions. This paper presents a novel **unsupervised anomaly detection system** using pressure, inertial, or related sensor data to automatically identify deviations from personalized sitting patterns, without the need for labelled data. The method operates in two stages: (1) modeling normal posture behavior per user, and (2) detecting anomalies in real time. Comparative analysis across multiple unsupervised algorithms shows that **dimensionality reduction techniques** notably enhance detection accuracy. The personalization of normal posture models further improves system performance, making this an effective solution for real-time posture monitoring in wheelchair users.<!--more-->
