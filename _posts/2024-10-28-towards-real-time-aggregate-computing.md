Aggregate computing is a promising programming paradigm for modeling and engineering **collective adaptive systems**, where global behaviors emerge from local interactions among distributed entities. This paper explores an extension towards **real-time aggregate computing**, aiming to enrich the paradigm with time-aware constructs that guarantee predictable and coordinated system behaviors under timing constraints. The proposed approach provides a foundation for rigorous modeling of distributed systems that must operate in real-time, paving the way for applications in safety-critical and adaptive domains.<!--more-->
