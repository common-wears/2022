# GENERAL OBJECTIVE

**COMMON-WEARS** is a new way to boost cooperation among wearables users in different scenarios. By using novel models at the device, network, middleware, service layers, supporting architecture and engineering tools, COMMON-WEARS overcomes the lack of cooperation and multi-user orientation in current wearables technology. The feasibility and effectiveness of this approach will be assessed via both real and simulated community-oriented use cases in three areas: primary health care, emergency response and pandemic management

## Use Case 1. Operating Room Collective Intelligence
The community engaged in this use case is the surgical team working in the Operating Room (OR). The OR is a complex and technology-rich environment in which an effective communication and coordination of the
surgical team is crucial for safe and efficient functioning. The team members (e.g., surgeons, nurses, and anaesthetists) should adapt their own inputs and efforts to those of their teammates to accomplish shared
goals, carry out planned tasks and handle unexpected events. This group ability, known as Collective Intelligence (CI), may positively impact on patient safety and surgical outcomes given the task and environment
complexity. Although OR team performance is recognized as a factor to pursue good surgical care and good surgical outcomes, surprisingly, practical issues of developing quantitative and objective measurements in the
OR need to be still solved. Thus, new methods for objective measurements to evaluate the team performance should be defined to support the CI. COMMON-WEARS aims at mapping and fostering the CI through a
community-driven approach able to improve OR team performance through the connection among surgical team members. It proposes a strategy grounded on three main Key Enabling Features (KEF) to overcome the
existing limitations (Fig.2.1).
