# CONTEXT
Gartner estimates the global smart wearable computing systems (WCS) market will be worth more than US$93 billion in 2022, with an increasing growth caused by the COVID-19. The industry and public sector are then pushing for innovative WCS solutions with high levels of dependability and trustworthiness that can efficiently operate in increasingly complex scenarios. Great strives have been made to realize WCS for the 24/7 monitoring of single users based on 3-tier architectures involving wearables, edge, and cloud systems. However, new requirements, specifically targeting cooperative multiple users, demands for radically new approaches, as promoted by the community-oriented WCS (CO-WCS) proposed here.  

# OBJECTIVES
  - Develop novel models and architectures for next-generation community-oriented wearable computing systems  
  - Define a rigorous engineering methodology, with associated formal verification and simulation tools, to drive the development lifecycle of CO-WCS
  - Create a pilot in a real instrumented environment to support activities of surgical teams in operating rooms
  - Educate 5 young researchers in the area of CO-WCS
  - Disseminate the results to scientific community, stakeholders and general public
  - Pursue CO-WCS standardization via contribution to IEEE Global Wearables and Medical IoT Interoperability & Intelligence Program of IEEE SA to which the project PI participates  

# RESEARCH
COMMON-WEARS moves the research front by developing models, architectures, and engineering tools for the next generation of wearable computing systems, namely, those featuring multi-user collectives of smart wearables and body sensor networks (BSN), with applications, e.g., in domestic, urban, manufacturing, emergency, and working environments. This will be achieved by combining recent research conducted by the proposers in aggregate computing, collective opportunistic IoT, machine learning, and WCS/BSN architectures. We will demonstrate results on challenging use cases in the areas of healthcare, emergency response and pandemic management that are strongly impacted by smart wearables.

# OUTCOMES AND IMPACT
The combination of new scientific results beyond the state of the art and real-life and simulation-based demonstrators will increase impact of results both in research and industry. The project outcomes have the potential of opening up a new era of WCS as an enabler for smart services based on CO-WCS. COMMON-WEARS has several potential impacts for value creation: Its research will make major theoretical, methodological and experimental contributions towards a better understanding of how to support communities with smart wearables; The overall project contribution is in line with the Horizon Europe clusters and towards supporting UN Sustainable Development Goals; The dissemination activities target the scientific community and key industry and public sector stakeholders, as well as the general public, to maximize impact of results.
