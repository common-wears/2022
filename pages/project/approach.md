## COMMON-WEARS Approach  
  - Wearable BSN (WBSN): a set of wearable sensors coordinated by a (mobile) base station device, worn by some individual;  
  - Inter-wearable mobile ad-hoc network: a network of wearables (worn by multiple individuals), in which wearables can directly interact with each other as in a mobile ad-hoc network;  
  - Inter-WBSN mobile ad-hoc networks: a mobile ad-hoc network of the WBSN base stations, mainly represented by (mobile) edge devices;  
  - Inter-WCS cloud network: a cloud system supporting the whole WCS.  

## SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  
According to the above description, the specific objectives (SOs) that will be pursued by the project, include:  

  - SO1: develop the COMMON-WEARS models and associated programming abstractions, suitable for defining and composing smart services and applications for CO-WCS, and scalable to large numbers of cooperative wearables/BSNs distributed over large-area environments;
  - SO2: develop a prototype architecture (i.e., a middleware and associated APIs) to support deployment and execution of CO-WCS according to the COMMON-WEARS models;     
  - SO3: develop a rigorous engineering methodology to guide developers in the analysis and design of complex CO-WCS services/applications, and tool support for functional and non-functional validation, through both formal (static and runtime) verification and simulation;  
  - SO4: test on both real and simulated community-oriented platforms use cases: i) a pilot testbed in a real instrumented environment to monitor and support activities of surgical teams in ORs; ii) a simulation testbed to analyse emergency response scenarios for mass casualties events, involving mobile teams of emergency operators acting on specific emergencies; and iii) a simulated large-scale testbed of pandemic management with specific focus on COVID-19.
