## [THE PROJECT](https://common-wears.github.io/2022/project/) &emsp; [STATE-OF-THE-ART](https://common-wears.github.io/2022/project/state-of-the-art/) &emsp; [APPROACH](https://common-wears.github.io/2022/project/approach/) &emsp; [USECASE](https://common-wears.github.io/2022/project/usecase/)  
 
### 
One of the main concerns within the field of wearables is the large spread of this technology for the effective support of communities: wearables are mainly designed and implemented using a single-user oriented approach. COMMON-WEARS addresses these concerns by proposing a new way to boost CO-WCS in different scenarios by novel models at the device, network, middleware, service layers, supporting architecture, and associated engineering tools. These solutions aim at overcoming the lack of cooperation and multi-user orientation, collective system programming, trustworthiness, interoperability, and scalability of current WCS. Feasibility and effectiveness of our approach will be assessed via both real and simulated community-oriented use cases in three areas: primary health care, emergency response and pandemic management.  

COMMON-WEARS approach is based on CO-WCS featured by collaborative wearable devices, multi-tier self-organizing and dynamic computing and communication architectures, collective programming models, and learning-based algorithms for multi-user activity recognition and situation awareness. Moreover, as CO-WCS will raise the level of complexity of their development, we also aim to define novel engineering methodologies and tools for easing CO-WCS development.

In particular, the following specific objectives will be addressed:
  - Develop the COMMON-WEARS models and associated programming abstractions, suitable for defining and composing smart services and applications for CO-WCS, and scalable to large numbers of cooperative wearables/BSNs distributed over large-area environments;
  - Develop a prototype architecture (i.e., a middleware and associated APIs) to support deployment and execution of CO-WCS according to the COMMON-WEARS models;
  - Develop a rigorous engineering methodology to guide developers in the analysis and design of complex CO-WCS services/applications, and tool support for functional and non-functional validation, through both formal (static and runtime) verification and simulation;
  - Test on both real and simulated community-oriented platforms use cases: i) a pilot testbed in a real instrumented environment to monitor and support activities of surgical teams in ORs; ii) a simulation testbed to analyse emergency response scenarios for mass casualties events, involving mobile teams of emergency operators acting on specific emergencies; and iii) a simulated large-scale testbed of pandemic management with specific focus on COVID-19.
