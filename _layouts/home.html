          The objective of the project is to develop novel models and architectures 
		  for next-generation community-oriented wearable computing systems, define a 
		  rigorous engineering methodology, with associated formal verification and simulation 
		  tools, to drive the development lifecycle of CO-WCS, and create a pilot in a real 
		  instrumented environment to support activities of surgical teams in operating rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          COMMON-WEARS moves the research front by developing models, architectures, and engineering 
		  tools for the next generation of wearable computing systems, namely, those featuring multi-user 
		  collectives of smart wearables and body sensor networks (BSN), with applications, e.g., in domestic,
		  urban, manufacturing, emergency, and working environments. This will be achieved by combining recent 
		  research conducted by the proposers in aggregate computing, collective opportunistic IoT, machine learning, 
		  and WCS/BSN architectures. We will demonstrate results on challenging use cases in the areas of healthcare, 
		  emergency response and pandemic management that are strongly impacted by smart wearables.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of new scientific results beyond the state of the art and real-life and simulation-based 
		  demonstrators will increase impact of results both in research and industry. The project outcomes have 
		  the potential of opening up a new era of WCS as an enabler for smart services based on CO-WCS. 
		  COMMON-WEARS has several potential impacts for value creation: Its research will make major theoretical, 
		  methodological and experimental contributions towards a better understanding of how to support communities 
		  with smart wearables; The overall project contribution is in line with the Horizon Europe clusters and 
		  towards supporting UN Sustainable Development Goals; The dissemination activities target the scientific 
		  community and key industry and public sector stakeholders, as well as the general public, to maximize impact of results.
